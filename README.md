## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional)
- OpenAI API key
- Hugging Face token (for embeddings)

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/legal-ai.git
cd legal-ai
```

2. Set up backend:
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

### Running with Docker

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Access the application:
- Frontend: http://localhost:80
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/docs

## Architecture Overview

The system consists of several key components:
